## JavaScript Quiz

It wasn't easy to make this assignment work. It's a short, timed quiz about JavaScript. I heavily relied on a youtube video for much of the design and function, so here's a link to the video by the Web Design Simplified channel for credit: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=riDzcEQbX6k&ab_channel=WebDevSimplified.

Then I watched other videos from class and online to come up with my own timer.
